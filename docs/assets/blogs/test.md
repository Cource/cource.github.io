# Emacs is a cool tool
Once you go emacs, there aint no going back. This is nice. These are
sentences and some phrases which may be statements or questions.
Either way,it does not matter, as one would be able to parse it as
such anyway.

## The usecase
You can use emacs for various purposes like:
- Writing
- Editing Code
So, basically just text manipulation. But there are folks who have
added functionality like using emacs as an interface for an LLM, or
using it as a desktop window manager itself (EXWM is such a project).

## Configuration
One of the best things about emacs is that you can configure it in an
actual programming language, that being LISP. Emacs uses a specific
flavour of LISP called elisp or emacs-lisp.
Here is a byte of elisp code:
```lisp
(defun real-code (a, b)
       (+ a b))
(real-code 1 2)
```
